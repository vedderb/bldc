Hello. I'm Will Lee. I tried to contact you via the email benjamin@vedder.se a few days ago, but I haven't received a reply from you. I imagine that you must be busy with your project. I'm really sorry to reach out to you in this way. If you have some time recently, please take one or two minutes to check the email I sent you. Then you'll know my purpose. You can get in touch with me via email.  
Thans!
