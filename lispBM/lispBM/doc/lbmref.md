# LispBM Reference Manual

## About Symbols

Symbols are very important and central to LispBM and also perhaps a bit different from identifiers/names used in languages such as C. A short introduction to symbols could be a good place to start. 

One way to think about a symbol is as a name. Used as a name, a symbol can identify a value or function in the environment. A symbol can also be used as data in and of itself, more on this later. 



---

**NOTE**
Symbols are expressed as strings in your program such as `a`, `let`, `define`, `+` or `orange`. The "reader", the part of LBM that parses code, translates each symbol into a 28bit value. The string `orange` for example is only of interest if you print a symbol and then the runtime system will look up what string corresponds to the 28bit identifier you want to print. So the runtime system is never wasting time comparing strings to see if a symbol is this or that symbol, it's all integer comparisons. 


---

You associate values with symbols using, <a href="#define">define</a>, <a href="#let">let</a> and you can change the value bound to a "variable" using <a href="#set">set</a>, <a href="#setvar">setq</a> or <a href="#setvar">setvar</a>. 

Not all symbols are treated the same in LBM. Some symbols are treated as special because of their very fundamental nature. Among these special symbols you find `define`, `let` and `lambda` for example. These are things that you should not be able to redefine and trying to redefine them leads to an error. Symbols that start with `ext-` are special and reserved for use together with extensions that are loaded and bound at runtime. 

Examples of symbols used as data are `nil` and `t`. `nil` represents "nothing", the empty list or other similar things and `t` represents true.  But any symbol can be used as data by quoting it `'`, see <a href="#quotes-and-quasiquotation"> Quotes and Quasiquotation </a>. 

### Valid Symbol Names

A symbol is a string of characters following the rules: 1. The first character is a one of 'a' - 'z' or 'A' - 'Z' or '+-*/=<>#!'. 2. The rest of the characters are in 'a' - 'z' or 'A' - 'Z' or '0' - '9' or '+-*/=<>!?_'. 3. At most 256 characters long. 

Note that lower-case and upper-case alphabetical letters are considered identical so the symbol `apa` is the same symbol as `APA`. 

examples of valid symbols: ``` apa apa? !apa kurt_russel_is_great ``` 



## Numbers and numerical types

LBM supports signed and unsigned integer types as well as float and double. The numerical types in LBM are 

   - byte   - unsigned 8bit value.
   - i      - signed 28bit value  (56bits on 64bit platforms).
   - u      - unsigned 28bit value (56bits on 64bit platforms).
   - i32    - signed 32bit value.
   - u32    - unsigned 32bit value.
   - i64    - signed 64bit value.
   - u64    - unsigned 64bit value.
   - f32    - (float) a 32bit floating point value.
   - f64    - (double) a 64bit floating point value.

The byte and the char value have identical representation and type, thus char is an unsigned 8 bit type in LBM. 

An integer literal is interpreted to be of type `i`, a 28/56bit signed integer value.  A literal with decimal point is interpreted to be a type `f32` or float value. 

To specify literals of the other types, the value must be postfixed with a qualifier string.  The qualifiers available in LBM are: `b`, `i`, `u`, `i32`, `u32`, `i64`, `u64`, `f32` and `f63`.  The `i` and `f32` qualifiers are never strictly needed but can be added if one so wishes. An alternative way of writing byte literals is using [Character literals](#character-literals) (e.g. `\#a`). 

So for example: 

   - `1b`     - Specifies a byte typed value of 1
   - `1.0f64` - Specifies a 64bit float with value 1.0.
   - `\#a`   - Specifies a byte type value of 97.

**Note** that it is an absolute requirement to include a decimal when writing a floating point literal in LBM. 

We are trying to make type conversions feel familiar to people who know a bit of  C programming. On a 32bit platform LBM numerical types are ordered according to: `byte < i < u < i32 < u32 < i64 < u64 < float < double`.  Operations such as `(+ a b)`, figures out the largest type according to the ordering above and converts all the values to this largest type. 

Example: 

   - `(+ 1u 3i32)` - Promotes the 1u value type i32 and performs the addition, resulting in 4i32.
   - `(+ 1  3.14)` - Here the value 1 is of type `i` which is smaller than `f32`, the result 4.14f32.

A potential source of confusion is that `f32` is a larger type than `i64` and `u64`. this means that if you, for example, add 1.0 to an `i64` value you will get an `f32` back. If you instead wanted the float to be converted into a double before the addition, this has to be done manually. 

Example: 

   -  `(+ (to-double 1.0) 5i64)`    - Manually convert a value to double.

The `type-of` operation can be used to query a value for its type. On the numerical types the `type-of` operation answers as follows: 

   - `(type-of 1b)`     -> `type-char`
   - `(type-of 1)`      -> `type-i`
   - `(type-of 1u)`     -> `type-u`
   - `(type-of 1i32)`   -> `type-i32`
   - `(type-of 1u32)`   -> `type-u32`
   - `(type-of 1i64)`   -> `type-i64`
   - `(type-of 1u64)`   -> `type-u64`
   - `(type-of 1.0)`    -> `type-float`
   - `(type-of 1.0f64)` -> `type-double`


### Overflow behaviour

Operations on fixed bitwidth numerical types can lead to overflow. The ranges representable in 32bit LBMs integer types are the following: 

   - `type-char`  : 0 - 255
   - `type-i`     : -134217728 - 1342177272
   - `type-u`     : 0 - 268435455
   - `type-i32`   : -2147483648 - 2147483647
   - `type-u32`   : 0- 4294967295
   - `type-i64`   : -9223372036854775808 - 9223372036854775807
   - `type-u64`   : 0 - 18446744073709551615

### Cost of numerical operations

All Values in LBM are encoded in one way or another. The encoded value holds additional information about type and garbage collection mark bit.  Operations that operate on an LBM value needs to unpack this encoded format and extract the actual numerical information from the representation. This has a cost and operations on numbers are in general a bit slower than what one gets in, for example C. 

The chart below shows the time it takes to perform 10 million additions on the x86 architecture (a i7-6820HQ) in 32 and 64 Bit mode. 

![Performance of 10 million additions at various types on X86](./images/lbm_arith_pc.png "Performance of 10 million additions at various types on X86")

In 64Bit mode the x86 version of LBM shows negligible differences in cost of additions at different types. 

For addition performance on embedded systems, we use the the EDU VESC motorcontroller as the STM32F4 candidate and the VESC EXPRESS for a RISCV data point. 

![Performance of 100000 additions at various types on ESP32C3 and STM32F4](./images/lbm_arith_embedded.png "Performance of 100000 additions at various types on ESP32C3 and STM32F4")

In general, on 32Bit platforms, the cost of operations on numerical types that are 32Bit or less are about equal in cost. The costs presented here was created by timing a large number of 2 argument additions. Do not see these measurements as the "truth carved in stone", LBM performance keeps changing over time as we make improvements, but use them as a rough guiding principle. 


## Strings

LBM supports string literals, consisting of a pair of double quotes (`"`) with a string of characters in between. These evaluate to a byte array containing the bytes of these characters (in the source code's encoding), followed by a zero byte. 

Special characters can be written using escape sequences. They take the form of a backslash character (`\`) followed by some character from the list below and are replaced with their corresponding character at read time. A backslash followed by any other character is a read error. 


|Escape sequence|ASCII value|C equivalent|Character represented|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|`\0`|0x0|`\0`|Zero byte|
|`\a`|0x7|`\a`|[Bell character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character)|
|`\b`|0x8|`\b`|[Backspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backspace#^H)|
|`\t`|0x9|`\t`|[Horizontal Tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_Tab)|
|`\n`|0xA|`\n`|[Newline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)|
|`\v`|0xB|`\v`|[Vertical tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_Tab)|
|`\f`|0xC|`\f`|[Form feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formfeed)|
|`\r`|0xD|`\r`|[Carriage return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_Return)|
|`\e`|0x1B|`\e`|[Escape character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character#ASCII_escape_character)|
|`\s`|0x20|-|Space ` `|
|`\"`|0x22|`\"`|Double quote `"`|
|`\\`|0x5C|`\\`|[Backslash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backslash) `\`|
|`\d`|0x7F|-|[Delete character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delete_character)|

Note that unlike other languages, single quotes (`'`) can't be used to form string literals as it's busy being used for [quoting](#quotes-and-quasiquotation)! Therefore it doesn't need to be escaped within string literals. 


### Character literals

Individual characters can be written using character literals. They take the form of `\#` followed by any ASCII character (e.g. `\#a` or `\#X`), and evaluate to their corresponding numerical byte value (note the type!). Like strings, character literals also support escape sequences, in which case they evaluate to its value from the above table, and any invalid characters result in a read error.

## Syntax and semantics

Opinions on Lisp syntax varies widely depending on a persons programming experience and preferences. If you look around, or ask around you could find any of the following, and probably more views on lisp syntax: 

   - **Concise and expressive** Lisp syntax is quite minimalist, you can do a lot with very little syntax to learn about.
   - **Uniform and elegant** Data and code are represented in the same way. This property is called Homoiconicity.
   - **Too many parenthesis** A common complaint is that it can be easy to get lost in all the parantheses. While it may be easy to write lisp, it can be very hard to read someone elses code.

Lisp programs are written using S-expressions, a notation introduced by [McCarthy](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf). An S-expression describes a tree in an unambiguous way. An example of an S-expression is `(+ 1 2)` and the tree it represents is shown below: 

![Graph representation of s-expression](./images/add_one_two.png)

Another example `(+ (* a a) (* b b))` which as a lisp program means $a^2 + b^2$: 

![Graph representation of s-expression](./images/sum_of_squares.png)

In Lisp, which stands for "LISt Processor", a list is a right leaning tree ending in the symbol "nil". By convention these right leaning expressions are easy to write and requires only a few parentheses. The example below shows how the list created by lisp program `(list 1 2 3 4)` is represented as a tree: 

![Graph representation of s-expression](./images/list_1234.png)

A left leaning structure requires full parenthesization and can be expressed in lisp as `(cons (cons (cons (cons nil 4) 3) 2) 1)`. 

![Graph representation of s-expression](./images/snoc_1234.png)

The conventions strongly favor the right leaning case. 

There are no two different trees that correspond to a given S-expression and thus parsing of S-expressions is unambiguous. The unambiguous nature of S-expressions is useful in areas other than lisp programming as well. [KiCad](https://dev-docs.kicad.org/en/file-formats/sexpr-intro/) uses S-expressions to represent tree data in some of its file formats. Apparently [WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format) uses S-expressions as well to describe WebAssembly modules 


S-expressions are built from two things, **Atoms** and **Pairs** of S-expressions. So an S-expression is either: 


   -  An **Atom** *a* 
   -  A **Pair** *a*,*b* of S-expressions `(a . b)` 

In LispBM the set of atoms consist of: 

   - [Numbers](#numbers-and-numerical-types): Such as `1`, `2`, `3.14`, `65b`, `2u32`
   - [Strings](#strings): Such as "hello world", "door" ...
   - Byte Arrays: Such as [1 2 3 4 5]
   - [Symbols](#about-symbols): Such as `a`, `lambda`, `define`, `kurt-russel` ...

In LispBM a pair of S-expressions is created by an application of `cons` as `(cons a b)` which creates the pair `(a . b)`. Convention is that `(e0 e1 ... eN)` = `(e0 . ( e1 . ... ( eN . nil)))`. 

A structure such as `(e0 e1 ... eN)` is called a list. 

### The meaning (semantics) that LispBM imposes on S-Expressions

The S-expressions discussed in the previous section are merely tree structures. The Lisp evaluator provides a computational interpretation for these trees. However, not all trees are valid Lisp programs. This section focuses on those trees that do make sense as Lisp programs and their meaning to the Lisp evaluator. 

**Values and expressions** 

The LispBM evaluator transforms expressions into values. For instance, the expression  `(+ 1 2)` is evaluated to the value `3`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(+ 1 2)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

In LispBM the distinction between expressions and values is often blurred. For example, it is possible to write a function that returns a result that can itself be interpreted as code 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(defun mk-code (x) `(+ ,x 1))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(closure (x) 
  (append '(+) (list x) '(1))
  nil)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(mk-code 10)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(+ 10 1)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

The result of evaluating `(mk-code 10)` is the list containing a `+`, `10` and `1`. This list is the value that `(mk-code 10)` evaluates to. Now, the result of `(mk-code 10)`, since it is valid lisp, can be evaluated. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eval (mk-code 10))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
11
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

In most cases this is quite natural and our functions will result in, Strings, lists and numbers that are easily and naturally understood as values. 

Still, it is worthwhile to remember that values can be expressions and expressions can be values. 

**Errors** 

Some times evaluation is impossible. This could be because the program is malformed, a type mismatch or a division by zero (among many other possibilities). Errors terminate the evaluation of the expression. To recover from an error the programmer needs to explicitly `trap` it. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(trap (/ 1 0))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(exit-error division_by_zero)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Environments** 

LispBM expressions are evaluated in relation to a global and a local environment. An environment is a key-value store where the key is a lisp symbol and the value is any lisp value. 

The rest of this section will now explain the meaning of LBM programs by informally showing **expressions**, what **values** they evaluate into and how they change and depend on the environments 

**Atoms** 

Some atoms, such as Numbers, Strings and byte arrays cannot be further evaluated. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
10
```


</td>
<td>

```clj

```


</td>
</tr>

```


</td>
<td>

```clj

```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
[1 2 3 4]
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
[1 2 3 4]
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

Symbols evaluate by a lookup in the environment. First, the local environment is searched for a binding of the symbol. If unable to find a binding in the local environment, the global environment is searched. If unable to find a binding in the global environment as well, the runtime system attempts to dynamically load a binding using a system provided callback function. If all of the above fails to provide a value a `variable_not_bound` error is produced. 

**Composite forms** 

A composite form, such as `(e1 ... eN)` is evaluated in different ways depending on what `e1` is. There are three major categories that `e1` can fall into. Either `e1` is something that represents a function and `(e1 ... eN)` is a function application. Or `e1` is a so-called *special-form* that form the core of the LBM language. Or lastly, `e1` is anything else and the composite form is malformed and will ultimately result in an error. 

The composite form `(e1 ... eN)` is evaluated by first checking if `e1` is a special form or not. if `e1` is a special form the composite form is passed to a special-form evaluator. if `e1` is not a special form,  the composite form is evaluated as a function application. These two major branches of composite form evaluation are described below. 

**Special form evaluation** 

Below are a selection of basic special-forms in lispBM together with their evaluation process 

   - **quote**: `(quote a)` evaluates to a for any a
   - **define**: `(define s e)`, `e` is evaluated into `v` and the global environment is augmented with the pair `(s . v)`
   - **lambda**: `(lambda params body)` is evaluated into '(closure params body env)`. `env` is the local environment there the lambda expression is evaluated.
   - **if**: `(if e1 e2 e3)` is evaluated by evaluating `e1` into `v1` if `v1` is nil, `e3` is evaluated otherwise `e2` is evaluated.
   - **progn**: `(progn e1 e2 ... eN)` is evaluated by evaluating `e1` then `e2` and so on until `eN`. The value `v` that `eN` evaluats into is the value `(progn e1 e2 ... eN)` evaluates to.
   - **and**: `(and e1 e2 ... eN)` evaluates the `eI` expressions from left to right as long as they result in a non-nil value.
   - **or**: `(or e1 e2 ... eN)` evaluates the `eI` expressions from left to right until there is a non-nil result.

`and`, `or`, `progn` and `if` evaluates expressions in sequence. `if` evaluates first the condition expression and then either the true or false branch. `progn` evaluates all of the expressions in sequence. In the case of `and`, `or`, `progn` and `if`, the constituent expressions are all evaluated in the same local environment. Any extensions to the local environment performed by an expression in the sequence is only visible within that expression itself. 

   - **let**: `(let ((s1 e1) (s2 e2) ... (sN eN) e)` eI are evaluated in order into `vI`. The local environment is extended with `(sI . vI)`. `sI` is visible in `eJ` for `J >= I`. `e` is then evaluated in the extended local environment.
   - **setq**: `(setq s e)` is evaluated by first evaluating `e` into `v`. The environments are then scanned for a binding of `s`. local environment is searched first followed by global. If a binding of `s` is found it is modified into `(s . v)`.

If no binding of `s` is found when evaluating `(setq s e)` a `variable_not_bound` error is triggered. 

**Function application evaluation** 

The evaluation strategies explained here are applied to composite expressions of the `(e1 ... eN)` form where `e1` does not fall into the category of "special forms". 

In LispBM an `(e1 ... eN)` is evaluated by first evaluating `e1`. This is because depending on what kind of function object `e1` evaluates into, the application if evaluated in different ways. 

`e1` should evaluate into a `closure`, a "fundamental operation" or an "extension". fundamental operations and extensions take their arguments passed on the stack while a closure is applied in an environment extended with the argument value bindings. 

Depending on the value of `e1` the arguments are either evaluated left to right and the results are pushed onto the stack, or they are evaluated left to right and used to extend the environment. 

**The quote and the quasiquote** 

The LBM parser (Reader) expands usages of the character sequences: `'`, `` ` ``, `,` and `,@`. The `'` as in `'a` is expanded into `(quote a)` for any a. The remaining `` ` ``, `,` and `,@` are expanded into applications of `quote`, `append` and `cons` using the algorithms described by Bawden in [quasiquotation in lisp](https://brics.dk/NS/99/1/BRICS-NS-99-1.pdf#page=6). 

### Concurrency and Semantics

TODO: Finish section. 

## Functional and Imperative programming

To differentiate from Imperative and Functional, think of imperative programs  as sequences of operations that update a state and  functional programs as transformations of values through application  of compositions of functions. Functional programming languages often let functions be values, which means that functions  can be stored in lists, returned from other functions and so on 

LispBM is a multiparadigm programming language. Most languages are a mix of functional and imperative and differ in what style it makes most convenient. At one end of this spectrum we find C which makes imperative easy and functional hard,  and in the other end Haskell with the opposite favoritism. In LispBM we try to not unfairly favour any particular style over the other. 

Picking a functional or an imperative style does have consequences though. Functional LispBM programs have properties such as persistence of data, that can be broken using the imperative part of the language. 

With the imperative features of the language it is also in some  places possible to peek under the hood of the runtime system. you can detect when and how environments are shared or copied for example. Please avoid exploiting the power of destructive updates for evil purposes. 

The list below shows imperative operations from the core of LispBM. In the extension libraries there are many more of the kind. 

   - **set**      - Destructively update a binding. Similar to C's =
   - **setq**     - Destructively update a binding. Similar to C's =
   - **setix**    - Destructive update of element in list.
   - **setcar**   - Destructive update of car field in cons cell.
   - **sercdr**   - Destructive update of cdr field in cons cell.
   - **setassoc** - Destructive update of field in association list
   - **bufset**   - The bufset family of functions destructively updates ByteArrays.
   - **bufclear** - Destructive clear of ByteArray.
   - **progn**    - Sequence operations.
   - **define**   - In LispBM, variables can be defined more than once. A second define of a variable is a destructive update.

### //

Integer division operation. Like normal division except if the result is a floating point value it is cast to an integer, which floors the result. The form of a `//` expression is `(// expr1 ... exprN)`. Can be used as a elegant complement to `mod`, with `//` returning the quotient and `mod` returning the remainder of a division. 

<table>

## Comparisons


---


### eq

Compare values for equality. The `eq` operation implements structural equality. The form of an 'eq` expression is `(eq expr1 ... exprN)`. 
 Structural equality means that the values must have the identical in memory representations to be considered equal. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eq (+ 1 2) 3)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
t
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eq 1 1 1 1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
t
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eq 1 1 2 1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
nil
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eq (+ 3 4) (+ 2 5) (+ 1 6))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
t
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eq (list 1 2 3 4) (list 1 2 3 4))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
t
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eq (list 1 2 4 5) (list 1 2 3 4))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
nil
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### not-eq

`not-eq` implements the negation of eq. In other words, `(not-eq a b c)` evaluates to the same result as `(not (eq a b c))`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(not-eq (+ 1 2) 3)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
nil
```

```


</td>
<td>

```clj
t
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(not-eq (+ 3 4) (+ 2 5) (+ 1 6))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
nil
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(not-eq (list 1 2 3 4) (list 1 2 3 4))
```


</td>

```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>

```clj
(not-eq (list 1 2 4 5) (list 1 2 3 4))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
t
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### =

The `=` operation can only be used on numerical arguments. If you know you are comparing numbers, it will be more efficient to use `=`. 
 An important difference between `eq` and `=` is that `=` compare the numerical values of the arguments. A 3 is a 3 independent of them being different types. `eq` on the other hand compares the representations of the arguments exactly and they must match in structure, type and value to be considered equal.

<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>

```clj
(= 1 1)
```

## nil and t, true and false


---


### nil

Represents the empty list. The nil value is also considered to be false by conditionals. `nil` is a symbol but it cannot be redefined and will always evaluate to itself. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj

---


### t

All non nil values are considered true in conditionals. `t` should be used in cases where an explicit true makes sense. `t` is a symbol but it cannot be redefined and will always evaluate to itself. 

<table>

## Quotes and Quasiquotation

Code and data share the same representation, it is only a matter of how you look at it. The tools for changing view, or interpretation, are the quotation and quasiquotation operations. 


---


### quote

> ***Special form***

When the `'` quote operator is encountered by the reader it is removed and the code to the right is wrapped in `(quote ...)`. Evaluating a quoted expression `(quote a)` results in `a` unevaluated. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
'(+ 1 2)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(+ 1 2)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eval '(+ 1 2))
```


</td>
<td>

### `

The backwards tick operator `` ` `` is called the quasiquote. It is similar to `'` but allows splicing in results of computations using the [`,`](#comma) and the [`,@`](#commaat) operators. 

The result of `'(+ 1 2)` and `` `(+ 1 2)`` are similar in effect. Both result in the result value of `(+ 1 2)`, that is a list containing +, 1 and 2.  When `` `(+ 1 2)`` is read into the heap it is expanded into the expression `(append (quote (+)) (append (quote (1)) (append (quote (2)) (quote nil))))` which evaluates to the list `(+ 1 2)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
`(+ 1 2)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(+ 1 2)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
`(+ 1 ,(+ 1 1))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(+ 1 2)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(append '(+ 1) (list (+ 1 1)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(+ 1 2)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### , <a name="comma"></a>

The comma is used to splice the result of a computation into a quasiquotation. 

The expression `` `(+ 1 ,(+ 1 1))`` is expanded by the reader into `(append (quote (+)) (append (quote (1)) (append (list (+ 1 1)) (quote nil))))`. Evaluating the expression above results in the list `(+ 1 2)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
`(+ 1 ,(+ 1 1))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(+ 1 2)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### ,@ <a name="commaat"></a>

The comma-at operation is used to splice in the result of a computation (that returns a list) into a list when quasiquoting. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
`(1 2 3 ,@(range 4 10))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
```

## Built-in operations


---


### identity

The identity function takes one argument which it directly returns. The form of an `identity` expression is `(identity expr)`, where expr is an arbitrary lisp expression. `(identity expr)` is a function application so all normal function application rules apply. The most important property of function applications in this case is that the argument is evaluated which differentiates `identity` from `quote` which returns the argument unevaluated. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>

### rest-args

`rest-args` are related to user defined functions. As such `rest-args` is also given a brief explanation in the section about the  <a href="#lambda">lambda</a>. 

`rest-args` is a mechanism for handling optional arguments in functions. Say you want to define a function with 2 arguments and an optional 3rd argument. You can do this by creating a 3 argument function and check if argument 3 is valid or not in the body of the function 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(defun my-fun (x y opt)
  (if opt (+ x y opt) (+ x y)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(closure (x y opt) 
  (if opt (+ x y opt) (+ x y))
  nil)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 1 2 nil)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 1 2 100)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
103
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

This approach works well if your function has 1,2 or some other small number of optional arguments. However, functions with many optional arguments will look messy at the application site, `(my-fun 1 2 nil nil nil nil 32 nil kurt-russel)` for examples 

Functions you create, using lambda or defun, do actually take an arbitrary number of arguments. In other words, it is no error to pass in 5 arguments to a 2 argument defun or lambda function. The extra arguments will by default just be ignored. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(defun my-fun (x y)
  (+ x y))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(closure (x y) 
  (+ x y)
  nil)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 1 2)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 1 2 100 200 300 400 500)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

all of those extra arguments, `100 200 300 400 500` passed into my-fun are ignored. But if we want to, we can access these extra arguments through the `rest-args` operation. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(defun my-fun (x y)
  (apply + (cons x (cons y (rest-args)))))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(closure (x y) 
  (apply + (cons x (cons y (rest-args))))
  nil)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 1 2 100)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
103
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 1 2 100 1000 10000)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
11103
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

`rest-args` gives a clean looking interface to functions taking arbitrary optional arguments. Functions that make use of `rest-args` must, however, be written specifically to do so and are themself responsible for the figuring out the positional semantics of extra arguments. 

One was to explicitly carry the semantics of an optional argument into the function body is to add optional arguments as key-value pairs where the key states the meaning. Then `rest-args` becomes essentially an association list that you query using `assoc`. For example: 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(defun my-fun (x)
  (assoc (rest-args) x))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(closure (x) 
  (assoc (rest-args) x)
  nil)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 'kurt-russel '(apa . 10) '(bepa . 20) '(kurt-russel . is-great))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
is-great
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 'apa '(apa . 10) '(bepa . 20) '(kurt-russel . is-great))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
10
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 'bepa '(apa . 10) '(bepa . 20) '(kurt-russel . is-great))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
20
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

The `rest-args` operation also, itself, takes an optional numerical argument that acts as an index into the list of rest arguments. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(defun my-fun (i)
  (rest-args i))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(closure (i) 
  (rest-args i)
  nil)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 0 1 2 3)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
1
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 1 1 2 3)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
2
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(my-fun 2 1 2 3)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

### set

The `set` form is used to change the value of some variable in an environment. You can use `set` to change the value of a global definition or a local definition. An application of the `set` form looks like `(set var-expr val-expr)` where `var-expr` should evaluate to a symbol. The `val-expr` is evaluated before rebinding the variable. `set` returns the value that `val-expr` evaluates to. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(define a 10)
(set 'a 20)
a
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
20
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

`set` works in local environments too such as in the body of a `let` or in a `progn`-local variable created using `var`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(progn 
    (var a 10)
    (set 'a 20)
    a)
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
20
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

See  [`setq`](#setq)  for a version which does't evaluate `var-expr`, similarly to  [`define`](#define). 




---


### setvar

`setvar` is an alias of  [`set`](#set). 




---


### undefine

A definition in the global environment can be removed using undefine.  The form of an undefine expression is `(undefine name-expr)` where `name-expr` should evaluate to a symbol (for example `'apa`). 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(undefine 'apa)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
t
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

It is also possible to undefine several bindings at the same time by providing a list of names. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(undefine '(apa bepa cepa))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
t
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### eval

Evaluate data as an expression. The data must represent a valid expression. The form of an `eval` expression is `(eval expr)`. An optional environment can be passed in as the first argument: `(eval env-expr expr)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eval (list + 1 2))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eval '(+ 1 2))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eval '((a . 100)) '(+ a 1))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
101
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eval `(+ 1 ,@(range 2 5)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
10
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### eval-program

Evaluate a list of data where each element represents an expression. The form of an `eval-program` expression is `(eval-program program-expr)`. A `program-expr` is a list of expressions where each element in the list can be evaluated by `eval`. 

Note that eval-program can not take any extra environment argument. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eval-program (list (list + 1 2) (list + 3 4)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
7
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eval-program '((+ 1 2) (+ 3 4)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
7
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eval-program (list (list define 'a 10) (list + 'a 1)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
11
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(eval-program '( (define a 10) (+ a 1)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
11
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### apply

An apply expression has the form `(apply fun-expr args-expr)`, and it  applies `args-expr` to `fun-expr`. It can loosely be emulated by  `(eval (cons fun-expr args-expr))`, except for the property that the elements of `args-expr` aren't evaluated when you use `apply`.  `args-expr` itself is of course evaluated, but given the emulated form, the individual elements of the list would be evaluated again. This is a problem when your argument list may include symbols or any other values which change when evaluated. 

Note that `fun-expr` doesn't necessarily have to be a user defined function, but can be any value which can be applied, that is, a value which can be the first item in a list expression: `(fun ...)`. This includes (but is not limited to) user define functions (which end up as [`closure`](#closure) values), built-in functions, extensions, [`macro`](#macro)s, and even special forms  (but see **Footgun: Special forms** below). 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(defun my-fun (arg1 arg2)
  (str-join (list (to-str arg1) (to-str arg2)) " "))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(closure (arg1 arg2) 
  (str-join (list (to-str arg1) (to-str arg2)) " ")
  nil)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(apply my-fun '(a b))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
"a b"
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(apply + (list 1 2 3 4 5))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
15
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(apply list '(a b c))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(a b c)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(trap (eval (cons my-fun '(symbol-a symbol-b))))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(exit-error variable_not_bound)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(call-cc (lambda (return)
           (apply return '(return-through-apply))))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
return-through-apply
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Footgun: Special forms**  
[Special forms](#special-forms) are built in functions which control how their arguments are evaluated. This means that their implementations has custom logic for how to evaluate the arguments, which has the unfortunate consequence that to apply a list of arguments to them "without evaluating" said arguments would require specific logic for each special form's implementation. Given LispBM's nature of running in an embedded environment where binary size is a luxury this becomes highly impractical. Therefore the argument list is passed on unmodified to special forms. So `(apply def '(a 'symbol))` is *precisely* equivalent to `(eval (cons def '(a 'symbol)))`, `'symbol` will be evaluated!. 

This is most noticeable with `and` and `or`. They are special forms due to their short-circuiting behavior, where later arguments may not be evaluated depending on the previous arguments. Given that you only given them the symbol `t` or `nil` their special form status isn't a problem when it comes to `apply` since those symbols evaluate to themselves. The problem appears when you give `and` or `or` other "unstable" values like arbitrary symbols. Since they're special forms they will evaluate them another time. 

This behavior may be changed in the future, so please avoid writing programs which depend on this behavior. For the case of `and` and `or` you can define your own function which re-implement their behavior, which would be subject to `apply`'s non-evaluating property (see example below). 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(apply or '(nil t))
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
t
```


</td>

```clj
(trap (apply and '(symbol-a symbol-b)))
```

```clj
(trap (apply or '(nil symbol-b)))
```

```clj
(exit-error variable_not_bound)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(defun safe-and nil
  (foldl (lambda (acc x)
           (and acc x)) t (rest-args)))
(apply safe-and '(symbol-a symbol-b))
```

### read

Parses a string resulting in either an expression or the <a href="#read_error">read_error</a> in case the string can not be parsed into an expression. The form of a read expression is `(read string)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(read "1")
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
1
```

```clj
(lambda (x)
  (+ x 1))

</table>




---


### read-program

Parses a string containing multiple sequenced expressions. The resulting list of expressions can be evaluated as a program using <a href="#eval-program">eval-program</a>. The form of a read-program expression is `(read-program string)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(read-program "(define apa 1) (+ 2 apa)")
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
((define apa 1) (+ 2 apa))
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### read-eval-program

Parses and evaluates a program incrementally. `read-eval-program` reads a top-level expression then evaluates it before reading the next. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(read-eval-program "(define a 10) (+ a 10)")
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
20
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

`read-eval-program` supports the  [`@const-start`](#const-start) and [`@const-end`](#const-end) annotations which move all global definitions created in the program to constant memory (flash). 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(read-eval-program "@const-start (define a 10) (+ a 10) @const-end")
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
20
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### type-of

The `type-of` function returns a symbol that indicates what type the argument is. The form of a `type-of` expression is `(type-of expr)`. 

<table>

## Special forms

Special forms are like functions except that they choose what arguments are evaluated. This is in contrast to "normal functions", usually referred to as *"forms"* in other Lisps, which always evaluate every argument they are given. 

Note that some special forms are located in other sections to improve the document flow. These are: 

   - [`quote`](#quote)
   - [`and`](#and)
   - [`or`](#or)
   - [`match`](#match)
   - [`recv`](#recv)
   - [`recv-to`](#recv-to)
   - [`call-cc`](#call-cc)
   - [`call-cc-unsafe`](#call-cc-unsafe)
   - [`atomic`](#atomic)
   - [`macro`](#macro)
   - [`move-to-flash`](#move-to-flash)


---


### if

> ***Special form***

Conditionals are written as `(if cond-expr then-expr else-exp)`. If the `cond-expr` evaluates to [`nil`](#nil) the `else-expr` will be evaluated. For any other value of `cond-expr` the `then-expr` will be evaluated. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(if t 1 2)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
1
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(if nil 1 2)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
2
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### cond

> ***Special form***

`cond` is a generalization of `if` to discern between n different cases based on boolean expressions. The form of a `cond` expression is: `(cond ( cond-expr1 expr1) (cond-expr2 expr2) ... (cond-exprN exprN))`. The conditions are checked from first to last and for the first `cond-exprN` that evaluates to true, the corresponding `exprN` is evaluated. 

If no `cond-exprN` evaluates to true, the result of the entire conditional is `nil`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(define a 0)
(cond ((< a 0) 'abrakadabra)
      ((> a 0) 'llama)
      ((= a 0) 'hello-world))
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
hello-world
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(define a 5)
(cond ((= a 1) 'doughnut)
      ((= a 7) 'apple-strudel)
      ((= a 10) 'baklava))
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
nil
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### lambda

> ***Special form***

You create an anonymous function with lambda. The function can be given a name by binding the lambda expression using <a href="#define">define</a> or <a href="#let">let</a>. A lambda expression has the form `(lambda param-list body-expr)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(lambda (x)
  (+ x 1))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(closure (x) 
  (+ x 1)
  nil)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
((lambda (x)
   (+ x 1)) 1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
2
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

You can give more arguments to a function created using lambda. The extra arguments can be accessed in the lambda body by calling the `rest-args` function which gives back auxiliary arguments as a list. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
((lambda (x)
   (cons x (rest-args))) 1 2 3 4 5 6)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 2 3 4 5 6)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
((lambda (x)
   (cons x (rest-args))) 1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

`rest-args` takes an optional numerical argument that is used to index into the list containing the rest of the arguments. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
((lambda (x)
   (rest-args 0)) 1 2 3 4 5)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
2
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
((lambda (x)
   (rest-args 1)) 1 2 3 4 5)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
((lambda (x)
   (rest-args 2)) 1 2 3 4 5)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
4
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
((lambda (x)
   (rest-args 3)) 1 2 3 4 5)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
5
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### closure

> ***Special form***

A <a href="#lambda"> lambda </a> expression evaluates into a closure which is very similar to a <a href="#lambda">lambda</a> but extended with a captured environment for any names unbound in the param-list appearing in the body-expr.  The form of a closure is `(closure param-list body-exp environment)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(lambda (x)
  (+ x 1))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj

### let

> ***Special form***

Local environments are created using let. The let binding in lispbm allows for mutually recursive bindings. The form of a let is `(let list-of-bindings body-expr)` and evaluating this expression means that body-expr is evaluted in an environment extended with the list-of-bindings. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(let ((a 1)
      (b 2))
     (+ a b))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(let ((f (lambda (x)
           (if (= x 0) 0 (g (- x 1)))))
      (g (lambda (x)
           (if (= x 0) 1 (f (- x 1))))))
     (f 11))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
1
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

You can deconstruct composite values while let binding. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(let (((a b) (list 1 2)))
     (+ a b))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(let (((a . as) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6)))
     (cons a (reverse as)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 6 5 4 3 2)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### loop

> ***Special form***

loop allows to repeatedly evaluate an expression for as long as a condition holds. The form of a loop is `(loop list-of-local-bindings condition-exp body-exp)`. 

The  `list-of-local-bindings` are very similar to how `let` works, just that here the `body-exp` is repeated. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(define sum 0)
(loop ((a 0))
      (<= a 10)
      (progn 
          (setq sum (+ sum a))
          (setq a (+ a 1))))
sum
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
55
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### define

> ***Special form***

You can give names to values in a global scope by using define. The form of define is `(define name expr)`. The given expression is evaluated and the result is stored in the global environment under `name`. In lispbm you can redefine already defined values. It is also possible to remove bindings from the global environment, see [`undefine`](#undefine). 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(define apa 10)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
10
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### setq

> ***Special form***

The `setq` special-form is similar to `set` and to `setvar` but expects the first argument to be a symbol. The first argument to `setq` is NOT evaluated. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(define a 10)
(setq a 20)
a
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
20
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

Just like `set` and `setvar`, `setq` can be used on variables that are bound locally such as in the body of a `let` or a `progn`-local variable created using `var`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(progn 
    (var a 10)
    (setq a 20)
    a)
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
20
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### progn

> ***Special form***

The progn special form allows you to sequence a number of expressions. The form of a progn expression is `(progn expr1 ... exprN)`. 

The evaluation result of a progn sequence is the value that the last `exprN` evaluated to. This is useful for sequencing of side-effecting operations. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(progn 
    1
    2
    3)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(progn 
    (define a 10)
    (define b 20)
    (+ a b))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
30
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### {

> ***Special form***

The curlybrace `{` syntax is a short-form (syntactic sugar) for `(progn`. The reader replaces occurrences of `{` with `(progn`. The `{` should be closed with an `}`. 

These two programs are thus equivalent: 

```clj
 (progn
   (define a 10)
   (define b 20)
   (+ a b))
 ```
 

And 

```clj
 {
   (define a 10)
   (define b 20)
   (+ a b)
 }
 ```
 




---


### }

The closing curlybrace `}` should be used to close an opening `{` but purely for esthetic reasons. The `}` is treated identically to a regular closing parenthesis `)`. 

The opening `{` and closing `}` curlybraces are used as a short-form for `progn`-blocks of sequences expressions. 




---


### var

> ***Special form***

The var special form allows local bindings in a progn expression. A var expression is of the form (var symbol expr) and the symbol `symbol` is bound to the value that `expr` evaluates to withing the rest of the progn expression. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(progn 
    (var a 10)
    (var b 20)
    (+ a b))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
30
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(progn 
    (var a 10)
    (var b (+ a 10))
    (+ a b))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
30
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

You can deconstruct composite value while var binding. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(progn 
    (var (a b) (list 1 2))
    (+ a b))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
3
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(progn 
    (var (a . as) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6))
    (cons a (reverse as)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 6 5 4 3 2)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### trap

> ***Special form***

`trap` lets you catch an error rather than have the evaluation context terminate. The form of a trap expression is `(trap expr)`. If expr crashes with an error `e` then `(trap expr)` evaluates to `(exit-error e)`. If expr successfully runs and returns `r`, then `(trap expr)` evaluates to `(exit-ok r)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(trap (/ 1 0))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(exit-error division_by_zero)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(trap (+ 1 2))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(exit-ok 3)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

`trap` catches any error except for fatal errors. A fatal error will still lead to the context being terminated.

## Lists and cons cells

Lists are built using cons cells. A cons cell is represented by the lbm_cons_t struct in the implementation and consists of two fields named the `car` and the `cdr`. There is no special meaning associated with the `car` and the `cdr` each can hold a lbm_value. See <a href="#cons">cons</a> and <a href="#list">list</a> for two ways to create structures of cons cells on the heap. 

![cons cell](images/cons_cell.png "cons cell")

A cons cell can be used to store a pair of values. You create a pair by sticking a value in both the car and cdr field of a cons cell using either `'(1 . 2)` or `(cons 1 2)`. 

![pair](images/pair.png "pair")

A list is a number of cons cells linked together where the car fields hold values and the cdr fields hold pointers (the last cdr field is nil). The list below can be created either as `'(1 2 3)` or as `(list 1 2 3)`. 

![Graph representation of s-expression](./images/list_1_2_3.png)


### car

Use `car` to access the `car` field of a cons cell. A `car` expression has the form `(car expr)`. 

Taking the `car` of a number of symbol type is in general a <a href="#type_error">type_error</a>. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(car (cons 1 2))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
1
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(car (list 9 8 7))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
9
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### first

`first` is an alternative  name for the `car` operation. Use `first` to access the first element of a list or pair. A `first` expression  has the form `(first expr)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(car (cons 1 2))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
1
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(car (list 9 8 7))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
9
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### cdr

Use `cdr` to access the `cdr` field of a cons cell. A `cdr` expression has the form `(cdr expr)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(cdr (cons 1 2))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
2
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(cdr (list 9 8 7))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(8 7)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### rest

`rest` is an alternative name for the `cdr` operation. Use `rest` to access all elements except the first one of a list, or to access the second element in a pair. A `rest` expression has the form `(rest expr)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(cdr (cons 1 2))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
2
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(cdr (list 9 8 7))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(8 7)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### cons

The `cons` operation allocates a cons cell from the heap and populates the `car` and the `cdr` fields of this cell with its two arguments. The form of a `cons` expression is `(cons expr1 expr2)`. To build well formed lists the innermost cons cell should have nil in the cdr field. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 2 3)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(cons 1 2)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 . 2)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(cons + 1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(+ . 1)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(cons (cons 1 2) (cons 3 4))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
((1 . 2) 3 . 4)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### .

The dot, `.`, operation creates a pair. The form of a dot expression is `(expr1 . expr2)`. By default the evaluator will attempt to evaluate the result of `(expr1 . expr2)` unless it is prefixed with `'`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
'(1 . 2)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 . 2)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
'((1 . 2) . 3)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
((1 . 2) . 3)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### list

The `list` function is used to create proper lists. The function takes n arguments and is of the form `(list expr1 ... exprN)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(list 1 2 3 4)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 2 3 4)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### length

Computes the length of a list. The `length` function takes one argument and is of the form `(length expr)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(length (list 1 2 3 4))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
4
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### range

The `range` function computes a list with integer values from a range specified by its endpoints. The form of a range expression is `(range start-expr end-expr)`. The end point in the range is excluded. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(range 4 8)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(4 5 6 7)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(range 0 10)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(range -4 4)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### append

The `append` function combines two lists into a longer list. An `append` expression is of the form `(append expr1 expr2)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(append (list 1 2 3 4) (list 5 6 7 8))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### ix

Index into a list using the `ix` function. The form of an `ix` expression is `(ix list-expr index-expr)`. Indexing starts from 0 and if you index out of bounds the result is nil. A negative index accesses values starting from the end of the list. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(ix (list 1 2 3 4) 1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
2
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(ix (list 1 2 3 4) -1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
4
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### setix

Destructively update an element in a list. The form of a `setix` expression is `(setix list-expr index-expr value-expr)`. Indexing starts from 0 and if you index out of bounds the result is nil. A negative value -n will update the nth value from the end of the list. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(setix (list 1 2 3 4 5) 2 77)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 2 77 4 5)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(setix (list 1 2 3 4 5) -2 66)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 2 3 66 5)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### member

Check if a value is included in list. The form of an `member` expression is `(member value-expr list-expr)`. Equality is checked structurally, in the same way as [`eq`](#eq), meaning if you're checking numbers the types must match (see the following examples). 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(member 3 (list 1 2 3))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 2 3)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(member 3u (list 1 2 3))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
nil
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(member '(b c) '((a b) (b c)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
((a b) (b c))
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

This function can be used as a readable and efficient way of checking if a value is in some constant set of values. This often results in significantly less code than unrolling it as a series of [`eq`](#eq)s inside an [`or`](#or) expression. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(defun is-pet? (thing)
  (member thing '(cat dog)))
(is-pet? 'cat)
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
(cat dog)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(is-pet? 'car)
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
nil
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(defun is-pet-unrolled? (thing)
  (or (eq thing 'cat) (eq thing 'dog)))
(eq (is-pet? 'cat) (is-pet-unrolled? 'cat))
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
nil
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### setcar

```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### take

`take` creates a list containing the `n` first elements of another list. The form of a `take` expression is `(take list-exp n-exp)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(define apa (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))
(take apa 5)
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
(1 2 3 4 5)
```


</td>
</tr>

---


### drop

`drop` creates a list from another list by dropping the `n` first elements of that list. The form of a `drop` expression is `(drop list-exp n-exp)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(define apa (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))
(drop apa 5)
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
(6 7 8 9 10)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### reverse

`reverse` creates a list containing the same elements as an existing list but in reverse order. The form of a `reverse` expression is `(reverse list-exp)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(define apa (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))
(reverse apa)
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
(10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### rotate

`rotate` creates a list containing the same elements as an existing list but rotated some number of step along a direction. The form of a `rotate` expression is `(rotate list-exp dist-expr)`. The sign of the value dist-expr evaluates to, decides direction of rotation. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(define apa (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(rotate apa 1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(rotate apa -1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1)
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(rotate apa 3)
```

```clj
(rotate apa -3)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
(4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3)

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Rotating a list in the negative direction is slightly faster than rotating in the positive direction. The chart below shows the time 1 Million 3 step rotations take in each direction at varying list lengths. The data is collected on x86.

---


### merge

`merge` merges two lists that are ordered according to a comparator into a single ordered list. The form of a `merge` expression is `(merge comparator-exp list-exp1 list-exp2)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(define a (list 2 4 6 8 10 12))
(define b (list 1 3 5))
(merge < a b)
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
(1 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 12)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### sort

`sort` orders a list of values according to a comparator. The sorting algorithm used is an in-place merge-sort. A copy of the input list is created at the beginning of the sort to provide a functional interface from the user's point of view. The form of a sort expression is `(sort comparator-exp list-exp)` 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(define a (list 1 9 2 5 1 8 3))
(sort < a)
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
(1 1 2 3 5 8 9)
```

## association lists (alists)

Association lists (alists) are, just like regular lists, built out of cons-cells. The difference is that an alist is a list of pairs where the first element in each par can be thought of as a key and the second element can be thought of as the value. So alists implement a key-value lookup structure. 

`(list '(1 . horse) '(2 . donkey) '(3 . shark))` is an example of an alist with integer keys and symbol values. 


### acons

The `acons` form is similar to `cons`, it attaches one more element onto an alist. The element that is added consists of a key and a value so `acons` takes one more argument than `cons`. The form of an `acons` expression is `(acons key-expr val-expr alist-expr)`. The `alist-expr` should evaluate to an alist but there are no checks to ensure this. 

Example that adds the key `4` and associated value `lemur` to an existing alist. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(acons 4 'lemur (list '(1 . horse) '(2 . donkey) '(3 . shark)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
((4 . lemur) (1 . horse) (2 . donkey) (3 . shark))
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### assoc

The `assoc` function looks up the first value in an alist matching a given a key.  The form of an `assoc` expression is `(assoc alist-expr key-expr)` 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(assoc (list '(1 . horse) '(2 . donkey) '(3 . shark)) 2)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
donkey
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### cossa

The `cossa` function looks up the first key in an alist that matches a given value. The form of an `cossa` expression is `(cossa alist-expr value-expr)` 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(cossa (list '(1 . horse) '(2 . donkey) '(3 . shark)) 'donkey)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
2

### setassoc

The `setassoc` function destructively updates a key-value mapping in an alist. The form of a `setassoc` expression is `(setassoc alist-expr key-expr value-expr)`. If you assign a key which doesn't exist in the original alist, it is left unchanged, while another association pair is added to the returned list. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(define apa (list '(1 . horse) '(2 . donkey) '(3 . shark)))
(setassoc apa 2 'llama)
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
((1 . horse) (2 . llama) (3 . shark))
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(setassoc apa 4 'mouse)
```


</td>

## Byte buffers


---


### bufcreate

Create an array of bytes. The form of a `bufcreate` expression is `(bufcreate size-expr)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(define data (bufcreate 10))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(define empty-array (bufcreate 0))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
[]
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

Alternatively a buffer can be allocated from a compactable memory region (defrag mem). 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>

### bufget-[X]

Read a value from a buffer. The contents of a buffer can be read as a sized integer or unsigned value using as many bytes from the buffer as the X portion of the function name implies. The form of a bufget expression is `(bufget-[X] buf-expr ix-expr)` where `ix-expr` evaluates to a number indicating the byte position to start reading from.

### bufclear

To clear a byte array the function bufclear can be used `(bufclear arr optByte optStart optLen)` Where arr is the byte array to clear, optByte is the optional argument of what to clear with (default 0), optStart is the optional argument of which position to start clearing (default 0) and optLen is the optional argument of how many bytes to clear after start (default the entire array). Example:

### Byte buffer literal syntax

Byte buffer literals can be created using the `[` and `]` syntax to enclose values to initialize the array with. The `[` and `]` syntax is complete resolved in the reader and thus cannot contain arbitrary lisp terms. the values listed between the `[` and the `]` must be literals! 

The form of the `[` and `]` syntax is `[ val1 ... valN ]`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]
```


</td>
<td>

```clj

## Arrays

LispBM supports arrays of arbitrary lisp values (including other arrays). 


### array literals

An array literal are specified as a sequence of lisp values between `[|` and `|]`. Values in a literal array are not evaluated. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>

All arrays have an associated heap-cell that acts as a liaison in relation to the garbage collector. When garbage collection frees the liaison, it also frees the array data in buffers and arrays memory (lbm_memory).

### array

`array` takes n arguments and creates an array holding those arguments as values. The form of an `array` expression is `(array expr1 ... exprN)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(define my-arr (array 1 2 3))
```


</td>

```clj
(define my-arr (array (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
[|3 7|]
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### mkarray

Allocate an array with `mkarray`. Arrays are allocated in arrays and byte buffer memory. The form an `mkarray` expression is `(mkarray num-expr)`. 

Note that there is currently no literal syntax for arrays. 

The example below allocates an array in "lbm_memory" (arrays and byte-buffer memory). 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(define my-arr (mkarray 10))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
[|nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil|]
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### ix

Index into an array using the `ix` function. The form of an `ix` expression is `(ix array-expr index-expr)`. Indexing starts from 0 and if you index out of bounds the result is nil. A negative index accesses values starting from the end of the array. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(ix [|1 2 3 4|] 1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
2
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(ix [|1 2 3 4|] -1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
4
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### setix

Destructively update an element in an array. The form of a `setix` expression is `(setix arr-expr index-expr value-expr)`. Indexing starts from 0 and if you index out of bounds the result is nil. A negative value -n will update the nth value from the end of the list. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(setix [|1 2 3 4 5|] 2 77)
```


</td>

## Defragmentable memory

LBM has two types of memory, the HEAP and the LBM_MEMORY. Lists and pairs are all stored on the heap. Arrays and large values (such as 64bit numbers are stored on LBM_MEMORY. The HEAP has a nice property that all allocations on it are the same size and therefore the HEAP is immune to the problems caused by fragmentation. On LBM_MEMORY arbitrarily sized arrays can be allocated and fragmentation can cause an allocation to fail even though there is enough free bytes. 

One way to resolve the fragmentation problem is to use a compacting garbage collector. We have opted to not use a compacting garbage collector on the LBM_MEMORY as it is quite complicated. It is extra complicated given how this memory is a shared resource between C extensions and the lisp runtime system. 

Our solution is to allow the programmer to create a memory block inside of the LBM_MEMORY in which we will run a defragmentation routine when needed. The defragmentable memory can only be used to allocate non-zero sized byte arrays on the lisp side. The idea is that the programmer calculates the maximum size of simultaneously used arrays (+ the overhead of 3 words per allocation) needed for a small critical set of arrays used in the program and allocates a defragmentable memory of that size. 

The LBM (non-compacting) gabage collector frees arrays from a defragmentable memory area automatically. An allocation in the defragmentable memory area that fails triggers garbage collection followed by compaction (if needed). 


---


### dm-create

`dm-create` creates a region of defragmentable memory for bytearrays within LBM memory. The form of a `dm-create` expression is `(dm-create size-expr)`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(define dm (dm-create 1000))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
DM
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>



---


### dm-alloc

`dm-alloc` is used to allocate a byte-array from a region of defragmentable memory. The form of a `dm-alloc` expression is `(dm-alloc DM-expr size-expr)`. where `DM-expr` evaluates to the defragmentable region to allocate from and `size-expr` is the number of bytes to allocate. Each allocation uses up 12 extra bytes of header that you do not include in `size-expr`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(define arr10 (dm-alloc dm 10))
```


</td>

## Pattern-matching


---


### match

> ***Special form***

Pattern-matching is expressed using match. The form of a match expression is `(match expr (pat1 expr1) ... (patN exprN))`. Pattern-matching compares the shape of an expression to each of the `pat1` ... `patN` and evaluates the expression `exprM` of the pattern that matches. In a pattern you can use a number of match-binders or wildcards: `_`, `?`, `?i`,`?u`,`?float`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(match 'orange
       (green 1)
       (orange 2)
       (blue 3))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
2
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### no_match

The `no_match` symbol is returned from pattern matching if no case matches the expression. 

   - Add a catch-all case to your pattern-matching. `_`.




---


### _

The underscore pattern matches anything. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(match 'fish
       (horse 'its-a-horse)
       (pig 'its-a-pig)
       (_ 'i-dont-know))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
i-dont-know
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### ?

The `?` pattern matches anything and binds that anything to variable. Using the `?` pattern is done as `(? var)` and the part of the expression that matches is bound to `var`. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(match '(orange 17)
       ((green (? n)) (+ n 1))
       ((orange (? n)) (+ n 2))
       ((blue (? n)) (+ n 3)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
19
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### Match with guards

Patterns used in a match expressions can be augmented with a boolean guard to further discern between cases. A pattern with a guard is of the form `(pattern-expr guard-expr expr)`. A pattern with a guard, matches only if the pattern structurally matches and if the guard-expr evaluates to true in the match environment. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(define x 1)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
1
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(match x
       ((? y) (< y 0) 'less-than-zero)
       ((? y) (> y 0) 'greater-than-zero)
       ((? y) (= y 0) 'equal-to-zero))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
greater-than-zero
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Concurrency

The concurrency support in LispBM is provided by the set of functions, `spawn`, `wait`, `yield` and `atomic` described below.  Concurrency in LispBM is scheduled by a round-robin scheduler that splits the runtime system evaluator fairly (with caveats, below) between all running processes. 

When a process is scheduled to run, made active, it is given a quota of evaluator "steps" to use up. The process then runs until that quota is exhausted or the process itself has signaled it wants to sleep by yielding or blocking (for example by waiting for a message using the message passing system). 

A process can also request to not be "pre-empted" while executing a certain expression by invoking `atomic`. One should take care to make blocks of atomic code as small as possible as it disrupts the fairness of the scheduler. While executing inside of an atomic block the process has sole ownership of the shared global environment and can perform atomic read-modify-write sequences to global data. 


---


### spawn

Use `spawn` to launch a concurrent process. Spawn takes a closure and arguments to pass to that closure as its arguments. The form of a spawn expression is `(spawn opt-name opt-stack-size closure arg1 ... argN)`. 

Each process has a runtime-stack which is used for the evaluation of expressions within that process. The stack size needed by a process depends on  1. How deeply nested expressions evaluated by the process are.  2. Number of recursive calls (Only if a function is NOT tail-recursive).  3. The Number of arguments that functions called by the process take. 

Having a stack that is too small will result in a `out_of_stack` error. 

The default stack size is 256 words (1K Bytes) and should be more than enough for reasonable programs. Many processes will work perfectly fine with a lot less stack. You can find a good size by trial and error. 




---


### spawn-trap

Use `spawn-trap` to spawn a child process and enable trapping of exit conditions for that child. The form of a `spawn-trap` expression is `(spawn-trap opt-name opt-stack-size closure arg1 .. argN)`.  If the child process is terminated because of an error, a message is sent to the parent process of the form `(exit-error tid err-val)`. If the child process terminates successfully a message of the form `(exit-ok tid value)` is sent to the parent. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(defun thd nil
  (+ 1 2))
(spawn-trap thd)
(recv ((exit-error (? tid) (? e)) 'crash)
      ((exit-ok (? tid) (? v)) 'ok))
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
ok
```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(defun thd nil
  (+ 1 kurt-russel))
(spawn-trap thd)
(recv ((exit-error (? tid) (? e)) 'crash)
      ((exit-ok (? tid) (? v)) 'ok))
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
crash
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### self

Use `self` to obtain the thread-id of the thread in which `self` is evaluated. The form of a `self` expression is `(self)`. The thread id is of an integer type. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(self)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
4279
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### wait

Use `wait` to wait for a spawned process to finish. The argument to `wait` should be a process id. The `wait` blocks until the process with the given process id finishes. When the process with with the given id finishes, the wait function returns True. 

Be careful to only wait for processes that actually exist and do finish. Otherwise you will wait forever. 




---


### yield

To put a process to sleep, call `yield`. The argument to `yield` is number indicating at least how many microseconds the process should sleep. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(yield 10)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
t
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### sleep

'sleep' puts a thread to sleep and differs from 'yield' only in the argument. 'sleep' takes a floating point number indicating how long in seconds the thread should sleep at least. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(sleep 1.000000f32)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
t
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### atomic

> ***Special form***

`atomic` can be used to execute a LispBM one or more expression without allowing the runtime system to switch process during that time. `atomic` is similar to progn with the addition of being uninterruptible. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(atomic (+ 1 2)
        (+ 3 4)
        (+ 4 5))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
9
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### exit-ok

The `exit-ok` function terminates the thread in a "successful" way and returns a result specified by the programmer. The form of an `exit-ok` expression is `(exit-ok value)`.  If the process that calls `exit-ok` was created using `spawn-trap` a message of the form `(exit-ok tid value)` is be sent to the parent of this process.

### exit-error

The `exit-error` function terminates the thread with an error specified by the programmer.  The form of an `exit-error` expression is `(exit-error err_val)`. If the process that calls `exit-error` was created using `spawn-trap` a message of the form `(exit-error tid err_val)` is sent to the parent of this process. 




---


### kill

The `kill` function allows you to force terminate another thread. It has the signature `(kill thread-id-expr val-expr)`, where `thread-id-expr` is the thread that you want to terminate, and `val-expr` is the final result the thread dies with. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(defun f nil
  (f))
(define id (spawn f))
(kill id nil)
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
t
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

The `val-expr` can be observed if the thread exit status is captured using `spawn-trap` 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(defun f nil
  (f))
(define id (spawn-trap f))
(kill id 'kurt-russel)
(recv ((? x) x))
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
(exit-ok 111050 kurt-russel)
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

The `val-expr` could be used to communicate to a thread monitor that the thread it monitors has been intentionally but externally killed. 




---

## Message-passing


### send

Messages can be sent to a process by using `send`. The form of a `send` expression is `(send pid msg)`. The message, msg, can be any LispBM value. 




---


### recv

> ***Special form***

To receive a message use the `recv` command. A process will block on a `recv` until there is a matching message in the mailbox. The `recv` syntax is very similar to [match](#match). 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(send (self) 28)
(recv ((? n) (+ n 1)))
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
29
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>




---


### recv-to

> ***Special form***

Like [recv](#recv), `recv-to` is used to receive messages but `recv-to` takes an extra timeout argument. It then receives a message containing the symbol `timeout` after the timeout period ends. 

The form of an `recv-to` expression is `(recv-to timeout-secs (pattern1 exp1) ... (patternN expN))` 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(send (self) 28)
(recv-to 0.100000f32
         (timeout 'no-message)
         ((? n) (+ n 1)))
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
29
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```clj
(send (self) 'not-foo)
(recv-to 0.100000f32
         (foo 'got-foo)
         (timeout 'no-message))
```


</td>
<td>


```clj
no-message
```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

### set-mailbox-size

Change the size of the mailbox in the current process. Standard mailbox size is 10 elements.

## Flat values

Lisp values can be "flattened" into an array representation. The flat representation of a value contains all information needed so that the value can be recreated, "unflattened", in another instance of the runtime system (for example running on another microcontroller). 

Not all values can be flattened, custom types for example cannot. 

Flat values are designed for recursive encoding and decoding each sub-value contains all information about its size either implicitly or explicitly (as is the case with arrays). 

multibyte values are stored in network byte order (big endian). 

**Cons** A cons cell is encoded into a byte 0x1 followed by the encoding of the car and then the cdr field of that cons cell. 


|cons |car value|cdr value|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|0x1|M bytes|N bytes|

**Symbol as value** A symbol value can be flattened. Note that symbol values only make sense locally. A flattened symbol value will only make sense in the same runtime system instance that flattened it. 


|symbol-value|value|
|:----:|:----:|
|0x2|4 bytes on 32bit, 8 bytes on 64bit|

**Symbol as string** A symbol can be flattened as a string and thus make sense across runtime system instances. 


|symbol-string|string|
|:----:|:----:|
|0x3|zero terminated C style string|

**Byte Arrays** Byte arrays can be flattened and the length is stored explicitly. 


|byte array|size in bytes|data|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|0xD|4 bytes|size bytes|

The rest of the atomic types are flattened according to the following: 


|type|flat-id|value|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|byte|0x4|1 Byte|
|i28|0x5|4 Bytes|
|u28|0x6|4 Bytes|
|i32|0x7|4 Bytes|
|u32|0x8|4 Bytes|
|float|0x9|4 Bytes|
|i64|0xA|8 Bytes|
|u64|0xB|8 Bytes|
|double|0xC|8 Bytes|
|i56|0xE|8 Bytes|
|u56|0xF| 8 Bytes|

Note that some of the types are only present of 32Bit runtime systems and some only on 64 bit. i28 is present on 32 bit and i56 on 64 bit. likewise for u28 and u56. 

When LispBM unflattens a i56 or u56 on a 32bit system it creates a i64 or u64 in its place. 

Symbols as values, are not possible to transfer between runtime systems in general and is even more pointless between a 32 and 64 bit runtime system. 


### flatten

The `flatten` function takes a value as single argument and returns the flat representation if successful. A flatten expression has the form `(flatten expr)`. Note that `expr` is evaluated before the flattening. A flat value can be turned back into a normal lisp value applying `unflatten` 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Example </td> <td> Result </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(define a (flatten (+ 1 2 3)))
```


</td>
<td>

```clj
[5 0 0 0 6]

</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(unflatten a)
```


</td>

```


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```clj
(unflatten a)
```


</td>
<td>

```clj

```


</td>
</tr>
</table>

A flat value is a byte-array containing an encoding of the value. 




---


### unflatten

`unflatten` converts a flat value back into a lisp value. Te form of an `unflatten` expression is `(unflatten flat-value)`

## Macros

LispBM macros are created using the `macro` keyword. A macro is quite similar to [`lambda`](#lambda) in lispBM except that arguments are passed in unevaluated. Together with the code-splicing capabilities given by [quasiquotation](#quasiquotation), this provides a powerful code-generation tool. 

A macro application is run through the interpreter two times. Once to evaluate the body of the macro on the unevaluated arguments. The result of this first application should be a program. The resulting program then goes through the interpreter again to compute final values. 

Given this repeated evaluation, macros are not a performance boost in lispbm.  Macros are really a feature that should be used to invent new programming abstractions in cases where it is ok to pay a little for the overhead for benefits in expressivity. 


### macro

The form of a `macro` expression is: `(macro args body)`

## Call with current continuation

"Call with current continuation" is called `call-cc` in LBM. Call with current continuation saves the "current continuation", which encodes what the evaluator will do next, into an object in the language. This encoded continuation object behaves as a function taking one argument. 

The `call-cc` should be given a function, `f`, as the single argument. This function, `f`, should also take a single argument, the continuation. At any point in the body of `f` the continuation can be applied to a value, in essense replacing the entire `call-cc` with that value. All side-effecting operations operations up until the application of the continuation will take effect. 

From within a `call-cc` application it is possible to bind the continuation to a global variable which will allow some pretty arbitrary control flow. 

The example below creates a macro for a `progn` facility that allows returning at an arbitrary point.

 ```clj
 (define do (macro (body)
                   `(call-cc (lambda (return) (progn ,@body)))))
 ```

 The example using `do` below makes use of `print` which is not a built-in feature of lispBM. There are just to many different ways a programmer may want to implement `print` on an microcontroller. Use the lispBM extensions framework to implement your own version of `print`

 ```clj
 (do ((print 10)
      (return 't)
      (print 20)))
 ```

 In the example above only "10" will be printed. Below is an example that conditionally returns.

 ```clj
 (define f (lambda (x)
             (do ((print "hello world")
                  (if (= x 1)
                      (return 't)
                      nil)
                  (print "Gizmo!")))))
 ```

 


### call-cc

> ***Special form***

The form of a `call-cc` expression is `(call-cc f)`, where f is a function taking a continuation k. In code most uses of call-cc will have the form `(call-cc (lambda (k) expr ))`. When using `call-cc` the expr above is allowed to bind `k` to a global variable. 



---


### call-cc-unsafe

> ***Special form***

`call-cc-unsafe` is similar to `call-cc` in form. `(call-cc-unsafe f)` and in code usually as `(call-cc-unsafe (lambda (k) expr))`. When using call-cc-unsafe you must NOT let the `k` leak out of the scope created by the enclosing `call-cc-unsafe`! That is, if `k` is used at all, it must be within `expr`. Binding `k` (directly or indirectly) to a global is a violation of the trust I am putting in you. 



---

## Error handling

If an error occurs while evaluating a program, the process that runs that program is killed.  The result of the killed process is set to an error symbol indicating what went wrong. 

If the process was created using `spawn` (or equivalently, started by a issuing a command in the repl), the process dies and an error message is presented over the registered printing callback (dependent on how LispBM is integrated into your system). The `ctx_done_callback` is also called and performs other integration dependent tasks related to the shutting down of a process. 

If the process was created using `spawn-trap`, in addition to the above, a message is sent to the parent process (the process that executed the spawn-trap) containing information about the process that struck an error. See <a href="#spawn-trap">spawn-trap</a>. The parent process can now choose to restart the process that crashed or to take some other action. 

Another way to catch errors is to use `trap` which works similar to `spawn-trap` but it does not spawn a thread. `trap` takes one argument which is an expressions. The expression is evaluated and if it fails `(trap expr)` returns an object representing the error. For more information on `trap`, see  <a href="#trap">trap</a>. 


### read_error

The `read_error` symbol is returned if the reader cannot parse the input code. Read errors are most likely caused by syntactically incorrect input programs. 

   - Check that all opening parenthesis are properly closed.




---


### type_error

The `type_error` symbol is returned by built-in functions or extensions if the values passed in are of incompatible types. 




---


### eval_error

The `eval_error` symbol is returned if evaluation could not proceed to evaluate the expression. This could be because the expression is malformed. 

Evaluation error happens on programs that may be syntactically correct (LispBM has a very low bar for what is considered syntactically correct), but semantically nonsensical. 

   - Check the program for mistakes.
   - Are your parenthesis enclosing the correct subterms?
   - Check that you haven't written, for example, (1 + 2) where it should be (+ 1 2).




---


### out_of_memory

The `out_of_memory` symbol is returned if the heap is full and running the garbage collector was not able to free any memory up. 

The program you have written requires more memory. 

   - Increase the heap size.
   - Rewrite the application to use less memory.




---


### fatal_error

The `fatal_error` symbol is returned in cases where the LispBM runtime system cannot proceed. Something is corrupt and it is not safe to continue. 

   - If this happens please send the program and the full error message to blog.joel.svensson@gmail.com. It will be much appreciated.




---


### out_of_stack

The `out_of_stack` symbol is returned if the evaluator runs out of continuation stack (this is its runtime-stack). You are most likely writing a non-tail-recursive function that is exhausting all the resources. 

   - Check your program for recursive functions that are not tail-recursive Rewrite these in tail-recursive form.
   - If you spawned this process in a small stack. For example (spawn 10 prg), try to spawn it with a larger stack.




---


### division_by_zero

The `division_by_zero` symbol is returned when dividing by zero. 

   - Check your math.
   - Add 0-checks into your code at a strategic position.




---


### variable_not_bound

The `variable_not_bound` symbol is returned when evaluating a variable (symbol) that is neighter bound nor special (built-in function). 




---

## Flash memory

Flash memory can be used to store data and functions that are constant. Things can be moved to flash explicitly using the `move-to-flash` function or as part of the reading procedure. To move things automatically to flash during reading, there are `@`directives. 


---


### @const-start

`@const-start` opens a block of code where each global definition is moved to constant memory (flash) automatically. This can be used only together with the incremental reader (such as `read-eval-program`). 

A `@const-start` opened block should be closed with a `@const-end`. Constant blocks cannot be nested. 

```clj
@const-start
(defun f (x) (+ x 1))
@const-end

(+ (f 1) 2)
```



---


### @const-end

`@const-end` closes an block opened by `@const-start`. 




---


### move-to-flash

> ***Special form***

A value can be moved to flash storage to save space on the normal evaluation heap or lbm memory.  A `move-to-flash` expression is of the form `(move-to-flash sym opt-sym1 ... opt-symN)`.  The symbols `sym`, `opt-sym1 ... opt-symN` should be globally bound to the values you want moved to flash. After the value has been moved, the environment binding is updated to point into flash memory. **CAUTION** This function should be used carefully. Ideally a value should be moved to flash immediately after it is created so there is no chance that other references to original value exists.
