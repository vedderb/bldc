    from

  - Refactoring of array-reader. Array reading is nolonger done monolithically
    inside of the tokpar framework, but rather as a cooperation between the

    is only one expr in the progn sequence.

   of continuation identifiers in eval_cps. They are now compared in encoded
   form in the evaluator.
 - Added lbm_cadr and replaced lbm_car(lbm_cdr(x)) with lbm_cadr(x) in
   the evaluator.

Apr 10 2022: Version 0.5.1
 - Removed the prelude.lisp, prelude.xxd step of building LBM.
