DESCRIPTION
       Many programs read input from the user a line at a time.
       The  GNU  History library is able to keep track of those
       lines, associate arbitrary data with each line, and uti-
       lize  information  from  previous lines in composing new
       ones.


HISTORY EXPANSION
       The history library supports a history expansion feature
       that  is  identical  to  the  history expansion in bash.
       This section describes what syntax features  are  avail-
       able.

       History expansions introduce words from the history list
       into the input stream, making it  easy  to  repeat  com-
       mands,  insert  the arguments to a previous command into
       the current input line, or fix errors in  previous  com-
       mands quickly.

       History expansion is usually performed immediately after
       a complete line is read.  It takes place in  two  parts.
       The  first  is  to determine which line from the history
       list to use  during  substitution.   The  second  is  to
       select portions of that line for inclusion into the cur-
       rent one.  The line selected from  the  history  is  the
       event, and the portions of that line that are acted upon
       are words.  Various modifiers are available  to  manipu-
       late  the selected words.  The line is broken into words
       in the same fashion as bash does when reading input,  so
       that several words that would otherwise be separated are
       considered one word when surrounded by quotes  (see  the
       description   of   history_tokenize()  below).   History
       expansions are introduced by the appearance of the  his-
       tory  expansion  character, which is ! by default.  Only
       backslash (\) and single quotes can  quote  the  history
       expansion character.

   Event Designators
       An  event  designator  is  a reference to a command line
       entry in the history list.

       !      Start a history substitution,  except  when  fol-
              lowed by a blank, newline, = or (.
       !n     Refer to command line n.
       !-n    Refer to the current command line minus n.
       !!     Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym
              for `!-1'.
       !string
              Refer to the most recent  command  starting  with
              string.
       !?string[?]
              Refer  to  the  most  recent  command  containing
              string.  The trailing ? may be omitted if  string
              is followed immediately by a newline.
       ^string1^string2^
              Quick  substitution.   Repeat  the  last command,
              replacing string1 with  string2.   Equivalent  to
              ``!!:s/string1/string2/''  (see Modifiers below).
       !#     The entire command line typed so far.

   Word Designators
       Word designators are used to select desired  words  from
       the  event.   A : separates the event specification from
       the word designator.  It may be omitted if the word des-
       ignator  begins with a ^, $, *, -, or %.  Words are num-
       bered from the beginning of the  line,  with  the  first
       word being denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted into
       the current line separated by single spaces.

       0 (zero)
              The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the com-
              mand word.
       n      The nth word.
       ^      The first argument.  That is, word 1.
       $      The last argument.
       %      The  word  matched  by the most recent `?string?'
              search.
       x-y    A range of words; `-y' abbreviates `0-y'.
       *      All of the words but the zeroth.  This is a  syn-
              onym  for  `1-$'.  It is not an error to use * if
              there is just one word in the  event;  the  empty
              string is returned in that case.
       x*     Abbreviates x-$.
       x-     Abbreviates x-$ like x*, but omits the last word.

       If a word designator is supplied without an event speci-
       fication, the previous command is used as the event.

   Modifiers
       After  the  optional word designator, there may appear a
       sequence of one or more of the following modifiers, each
       preceded by a `:'.

       h      Remove  a  trailing  file name component, leaving
              only the head.
       t      Remove all leading file name components,  leaving
              the tail.
       r      Remove  a trailing suffix of the form .xxx, leav-
              ing the basename.
       e      Remove all but the trailing suffix.
       p      Print the new command but do not execute it.
       q      Quote the  substituted  words,  escaping  further
              substitutions.
       x      Quote  the substituted words as with q, but break
              into words at blanks and newlines.
       s/old/new/
              Substitute new for the first occurrence of old in
              the  event  line.   Any  delimiter can be used in
              place of /.  The final delimiter is  optional  if
              it  is the last character of the event line.  The
              delimiter may be quoted in old  and  new  with  a
              single  backslash.   If  &  appears in new, it is
              replaced by old.  A single backslash  will  quote
              the &.  If old is null, it is set to the last old
              substituted, or, if no previous history substitu-
              tions   took   place,   the   last  string  in  a
              !?string[?]  search.
       &      Repeat the previous substitution.
       g      Cause changes to be applied over the entire event
              line.   This  is  used  in  conjunction with `:s'
              (e.g., `:gs/old/new/') or  `:&'.   If  used  with
              `:s',  any  delimiter  can be used in place of /,
              and the final delimiter is optional if it is  the
              last  character  of  the event line.  An a may be
              used as a synonym for g.
       G      Apply the following `s'  modifier  once  to  each
              word in the event line.

PROGRAMMING WITH HISTORY FUNCTIONS
       This section describes how to use the History library in
       other programs.

   Introduction to History
       The programmer using the History library  has  available
       functions for remembering lines on a history list, asso-
       ciating arbitrary data with a line, removing lines  from
       the list, searching through the list for a line contain-
       ing an arbitrary text string, and referencing  any  line
       in  the list directly.  In addition, a history expansion
       function is available which provides  for  a  consistent
       user interface across different programs.

       The user using programs written with the History library
       has the benefit of a consistent user  interface  with  a
       set  of well-known commands for manipulating the text of
       previous lines and using that text in new commands.  The
       basic history manipulation commands are identical to the
       history substitution provided by bash.

       If the programmer  desires,  he  can  use  the  Readline
       library,  which  includes  some  history manipulation by
       default, and has the added  advantage  of  command  line
       editing.

       Before  declaring  any functions using any functionality
       the History library provides in other code, an  applica-
       tion writer should include the file <readline/history.h>
       in any file that uses the  History  library's  features.
       It supplies extern declarations for all of the library's
       public functions and variables, and declares all of  the
       public data structures.


   History Storage
       The history list is an array of history entries.  A his-
       tory entry is declared as follows:

       typedef void * histdata_t;

       typedef struct _hist_entry {
         char *line;
         char *timestamp;
         histdata_t data;
       } HIST_ENTRY;

       The history list itself might therefore be declared as

       HIST_ENTRY ** the_history_list;

       The state of the History library is encapsulated into  a
       single structure:

       /*
        * A structure used to pass around the current state of the history.
        */
       typedef struct _hist_state {
         HIST_ENTRY **entries; /* Pointer to the entries themselves. */
         int offset;           /* The location pointer within this array. */
         int length;           /* Number of elements within this array. */
         int size;             /* Number of slots allocated to this array. */
         int flags;
       } HISTORY_STATE;

       If the flags member includes HS_STIFLED, the history has
       been stifled.

History Functions
       This section describes the calling sequence for the var-
       ious functions exported by the GNU History library.

   Initializing History and State Management
       This  section describes functions used to initialize and
       manage the state of the History library when you want to
       use the history functions in your program.

       void using_history (void)
       Begin  a session in which the history functions might be
       used.  This initializes the interactive variables.

       HISTORY_STATE * history_get_history_state (void)
       Return a structure describing the current state  of  the
       input history.

       void history_set_history_state (HISTORY_STATE *state)
       Set the state of the history list according to state.


   History List Management
       These functions manage individual entries on the history
       list, or set parameters managing the list itself.

       void add_history (const char *string)
       Place string at the end of the history list.  The  asso-
       ciated data field (if any) is set to NULL.

       void add_history_time (const char *string)
       Change  the  time  stamp associated with the most recent
       history entry to string.

       HIST_ENTRY * remove_history (int which)
       Remove history entry at offset which from  the  history.
       The  removed  element  is  returned  so you can free the
       line, data, and containing structure.

       histdata_t free_history_entry (HIST_ENTRY *histent)
       Free the history entry histent and any  history  library
       private  data  associated with it.  Returns the applica-
       tion-specific data so the caller can dispose of it.

       HIST_ENTRY *  replace_history_entry  (int  which,  const
       char *line, histdata_t data)
       Make  the  history  entry  at offset which have line and
       data.  This returns the old entry so the caller can dis-
       pose  of  any application-specific data.  In the case of
       an invalid which, a NULL pointer is returned.

       void clear_history (void)
       Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.

       void stifle_history (int max)
       Stifle the history list, remembering only the  last  max
       entries.

       int unstifle_history (void)
       Stop stifling the history.  This returns the previously-
       set maximum number of history entries (as  set  by  sti-
       fle_history()).  history was stifled.  The value is pos-
       itive if the history was stifled, negative if it wasn't.

       int history_is_stifled (void)
       Returns  non-zero  if the history is stifled, zero if it
       is not.


   Information About the History List
       These functions  return  information  about  the  entire
       history list or individual list entries.

       HIST_ENTRY ** history_list (void)
       Return  a NULL terminated array of HIST_ENTRY * which is
       the current input history.  Element 0 of  this  list  is
       the  beginning  of time.  If there is no history, return
       NULL.

       int where_history (void)
       Returns the offset of the current history element.

       HIST_ENTRY * current_history (void)
       Return the history entry at  the  current  position,  as
       determined  by  where_history().   If  there is no entry
       there, return a NULL pointer.

       HIST_ENTRY * history_get (int offset)
       Return the history entry at  position  offset,  starting
       from  history_base.   If  there is no entry there, or if
       offset is greater than the history length, return a NULL
       pointer.

       time_t history_get_time (HIST_ENTRY *)
       Return  the time stamp associated with the history entry
       passed as the argument.

       int history_total_bytes (void)
       Return the number of  bytes  that  the  primary  history
       entries are using.  This function returns the sum of the
       lengths of all the lines in the history.


   Moving Around the History List
       These functions allow the current index into the history
       list to be set or changed.

       int history_set_pos (int pos)
       Set the current history offset to pos, an absolute index
       into the list.  Returns 1 on success, 0 if pos  is  less
       than zero or greater than the number of history entries.

       HIST_ENTRY * previous_history (void)
       Back up the current history offset to the previous  his-
       tory  entry,  and  return  a  pointer to that entry.  If
       there is no previous entry, return a NULL pointer.

       HIST_ENTRY * next_history (void)
       Move the current history offset forward to the next his-
       tory  entry, and return the a pointer to that entry.  If
       there is no next entry, return a NULL pointer.


   Searching the History List
       These functions allow searching of the history list  for
       entries  containing a specific string.  Searching may be
       performed both forward and  backward  from  the  current
       history  position.   The search may be anchored, meaning
       that the string must match at the beginning of the  his-
       tory entry.

       int history_search (const char *string, int direction)
       Search  the  history for string, starting at the current
       history offset.  If direction is less than 0,  then  the
       search  is  through  previous entries, otherwise through
       subsequent entries.  If string is found, then  the  cur-
       rent history index is set to that history entry, and the
       value returned is the offset in the line  of  the  entry
       where  string was found.  Otherwise, nothing is changed,
       and a -1 is returned.

       int  history_search_prefix  (const  char  *string,   int
       direction)
       Search  the  history for string, starting at the current
       history offset.  The search is anchored: matching  lines
       must  begin  with  string.  If direction is less than 0,
       then the search is through previous  entries,  otherwise
       through  subsequent  entries.   If string is found, then
       the current history index is set to that entry, and  the
       return value is 0.  Otherwise, nothing is changed, and a
       -1 is returned.

       int history_search_pos (const char *string,  int  direc-
       tion, int pos)
       Search  for string in the history list, starting at pos,
       an absolute index into the list.  If direction is  nega-
       tive,  the  search proceeds backward from pos, otherwise
       forward.  Returns the absolute index of the history ele-
       ment where string was found, or -1 otherwise.


   Managing the History File
       The  History library can read the history from and write
       it to a file.  This section documents the functions  for
       managing a history file.

       int read_history (const char *filename)
       Add the contents of filename to the history list, a line
       at a time.  If filename is NULL, then read from  ~/.his-
       tory.  Returns 0 if successful, or errno if not.

       int  read_history_range (const char *filename, int from,
       int to)
       Read a range of lines from filename, adding them to  the
       history list.  Start reading at line from and end at to.
       If from is zero, start at the beginning.  If to is  less
       than  from,  then  read  until  the end of the file.  If
       filename is NULL, then read from ~/.history.  Returns  0
       if successful, or errno if not.

       int write_history (const char *filename)
       Write the current history to filename, overwriting file-
       name if necessary.  If filename is NULL, then write  the
       history  list  to  ~/.history.  Returns 0 on success, or
       errno on a read or write error.


       int append_history (int nelements, const char *filename)
       Append  the  last nelements of the history list to file-
       name.  If filename is NULL, then append  to  ~/.history.
       Returns 0 on success, or errno on a read or write error.

       int history_truncate_file  (const  char  *filename,  int
       nlines)
       Truncate  the  history  file  filename, leaving only the
       last nlines lines.  If filename is NULL, then ~/.history
       is  truncated.   Returns 0 on success, or errno on fail-
       ure.


   History Expansion
       These functions implement history expansion.

       int history_expand (char *string, char **output)
       Expand string, placing the result into output, a pointer
       to a string.  Returns:
              0      If  no  expansions  took place (or, if the
                     only change in the text was the removal of
                     escape  characters  preceding  the history
                     expansion character);
              1      if expansions did take place;
              -1     if there was an error in expansion;
              2      if the returned line should be  displayed,
                     but not executed, as with the :p modifier.
       If an error ocurred in expansion, then output contains a
       descriptive error message.

       char  * get_history_event (const char *string, int *cin-
       dex, int qchar)
       Returns the text  of  the  history  event  beginning  at
       string + *cindex.  *cindex is modified to point to after
       the event specifier.  At function entry,  cindex  points
       to  the index into string where the history event speci-
       fication begins.  qchar is a character that  is  allowed
       to end the event specification in addition to the ``nor-
       mal'' terminating characters.

       char ** history_tokenize (const char *string)
       Return an array of tokens parsed out of string, much  as
       the shell might.  The tokens are split on the characters
       in the history_word_delimiters variable, and shell quot-
       ing conventions are obeyed.

       char  *  history_arg_extract (int first, int last, const
       char *string)
       Extract a string segment consisting of the first through
       last  arguments  present in string.  Arguments are split
       using history_tokenize().


   History Variables
       This section describes the externally-visible  variables
       exported by the GNU History Library.

       int history_base
       The  logical  offset  of  the first entry in the history
       list.

       int history_length
       The number of entries currently stored  in  the  history
       list.

       int history_max_entries
       The  maximum  number  of  history entries.  This must be
       changed using stifle_history().

       int history_write_timestamps
       If non-zero, timestamps are written to the history file,
       so  they can be preserved between sessions.  The default
       value is 0, meaning that timestamps are not saved.

       char history_expansion_char
       The character that  introduces  a  history  event.   The
       default is !.  Setting this to 0 inhibits history expan-
       sion.

       char history_subst_char
       The character that invokes word substitution if found at
       the start of a line.  The default is ^.

       char history_comment_char
       During  tokenization,  if  this character is seen as the
       first character of a word, then it  and  all  subsequent
       characters up to a newline are ignored, suppressing his-
       tory expansion for the remainder of the line.   This  is
       disabled by default.

       char * history_word_delimiters
       The  characters  that  separate  tokens for history_tok-
       enize().  The default value is " \t\n()<>;&|".

       char * history_no_expand_chars
       The list of characters which inhibit  history  expansion
       if  found  immediately following history_expansion_char.
       The default is space, tab, newline, \r, and =.

       char * history_search_delimiter_chars
       The list of additional characters which  can  delimit  a
       history  search string, in addition to space, tab, : and
       ? in the case of a substring  search.   The  default  is
       empty.

       int history_quotes_inhibit_expansion
       If non-zero, single-quoted words are not scanned for the
       history expansion character.  The default value is 0.

       rl_linebuf_func_t * history_inhibit_expansion_function
       This should be set to the address  of  a  function  that
       takes  two arguments: a char * (string) and an int index
       into that string (i).  It should return a non-zero value
       if  the  history  expansion starting at string[i] should
       not be performed; zero if the expansion should be  done.
       It  is  intended  for use by applications like bash that
       use the history expansion character for additional  pur-
       poses.  By default, this variable is set to NULL.
