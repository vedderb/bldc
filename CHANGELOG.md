* FOC: tweaked repetition counter and preload to get cleaner waveforms with low latency.
* FOC: Input voltage filterting and vd/vq filtering while undriven for more stable performance.

### 3.14
#### No official release
* Different throttle curve modes
* Improved FOC sensorless startup.

---

### 3.13
#### No official release
* Throttle curve for PPM, ADC and Nunchuk.
* Updated fix for throttle limits to prevent loosing range at high speed when the battery current limit is lower than the motor current limit.
* APP PPM ramping.
* APP ADC and PPM current range bug fix for some control modes.

---

### 3.12
#### No official release
* APP PPM throttle center setting.

---

### 3.11
#### No official release
* BLDC detect: disable direction inversion before detecting parameters.
* FOC speed control: remove supply voltage scaling since that does not make any sense in current control mode.
* BLDC speed control: added current-based speed controller option.
* BLDC: heavier RPM filtering.
* Speed control: option to disable braking in speed control mode.
* Added wattage limits. Useful for following laws for electric vehicles in some regions.
* Use override current limits to scale throttle inputs in apps. Will prevent the throttle from loosing rage at speed if e.g. the battery current limits are lower than the motor current limits.

### 3.10
#### Released 2016-11-06
* BLDC: removed cycles_running variable.
* BLDC: update ADC sampling in correct order to avoid corrupt samples when the switching frequency changes a lot at once.
* Terminal: print fault duty cycle state with one extra decimal.

### 3.09
#### Released 2016-11-06
* Configuration option for inverting the motor direction.
* STM32 96-bit unique ID readout.

---

### 3.08
#### No official release
* Communication protocol update for floating point variables. This breaks almost all compatibility with old firmwares.

---

### 3.07
#### Released 2016-11-04
* Delay after app and motor conf write.
	* Fixes NRF bug.
	* Fixes glitches if throttle is given while updating the configurations.
* Lock mc_interface while storing configuration.
* Nunchuk app local timeout.
	* Prevents the output thread from blocking other outputs after being used before.
* Lock MC interface while storing configurations to flash.

---

### 3.06
#### No official release
* spi_sw for NRF stop bug fix.

---

### 3.05
#### No official release
* App NRF pairing.
* App nunchuk chuk error restore bug fix.

---

### 3.04
#### No official release
* HW version built into firmware.
	* Allows VESC Tool to only list firmwares compatible with the hardware.

---

### 3.02
#### No official release
* hw_60 support.
* hw_das support.
* DRV8301 support.
	* SPI implementation.
	* Some terminal commands.
* DRV8313 support.
* 3 shunt support.
* Phase shunt support.
* Global RPM limit for both BLDC and FOC.

* Handbrake function for FOC (open loop braking).
* FOC updates and fixes.
	* Current control signs.
	* Control loop integrator fixes.
	* Phase delay compensation and minimization.
	* More consistent flux linkage detection.
	* Resistance and inductance measurement bug fix that could cause a reboot.
	* Timer sampling improvement and cleanup.
	* Support for sampling in V0 and V7 when using phase shunts.
* Fix reboot on over temperature fault code.
* Motor temperature measurement and soft backoff.
* Terminal command for rotating magnet field generation (ACIM experimentation).
* Prevent motor start command during initialization.
* Hardware specific default configuration support.
* Stop functionality for apps so that reboots are not required anymore when changing app.
* EEPROM emulation bug fix: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/issues/27
